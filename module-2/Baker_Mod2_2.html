    <p class="intro">
        Hi, my name is Zac Baker and I'm currently a student at Bellevue University majoring in Software Development.
        For years now, I have been interesting in programming and have slowly been making my way to making that a reality. I find it euphoric 
        trying to solve problems I find challenging or outright impossible. While I don't know exactly what the future holds, I am excited for
        this opportunity to progress in the field. My current goal is to either end up in web development or some sort of application development
        field.

        <span class="sentence">I grew up in Seoul, South Korea and lived there for 13 years.</span> This has always been a treasured part of my life as it was an incredibly unique
        experience that taught me a lot. Often times it leads me to have difficulty connecting with people but I wouldn't change this for the world.
        Growing up differently has shown me, first hand, that you can take advantage of any circumstance you are in. Life is always challening, but 
        learning lessons along the way make it all worth it in my book.

        Due to our background, my family is also heavily based internationally currently. I have family members in China, Phillipines, and Nebraska 
        who all do various things. Most of my family are international teachers and love experiencing new cultures while helping their students
        learn not just about their subjects but about life. Those of us who remain in the United States, while jealous, are also blessed with being closer
        to family and enjoying the smaller things in life.

        I have various hobbies but my main ones would have to be video games and golfing. I have been playing video games since I was a little kid and has
        just stuck with me through the years. It's both what I find enjoyable and doubles as a theraputic outlet when life becomes too much at times. Being able
        to "escape" from reality and simply enjoy my time has lead me to become who I am today. I was introduced to golf by my dad when I was a young kid. It 
        became something we did once a summer to spend time with the boys. In recent times it has grown to our primary way of getting out and being present 
        when everyone is back during vacations.
