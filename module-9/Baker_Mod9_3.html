        <p>
            Hi, my name is Zac Baker. Currently I am attending Bellevue University pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in software development. 
            Programming has been an interest of mine for the last eight or so years. I have attempted to delve into the field numerous times,
             each leading to immense <span id="frustration">________</span> leading to me dropping it. Attending school is something that I have always struggled with as well, 
             but the cohort program for the degree is setup perfectly. I feel as though it allows me to learn practical knowledge about the field 
             and helps me obtain the confidence I need to learn and feel comfortable to seek out answers on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I am generally a relaxed individual I have a few hobbies that I sink a fair amount of time into. 
            First and foremost, gaming has always been a passion of mine since I was little. It started off playing <span id="WarcraftIII">________</span> on my brothers computer. 
            Then progressed into playing League of Legends in High School. Now it has become something else entirely! I enjoy a wide variety of video games, 
            each providing their own sense of satisfaction. My other main hobby is <span id="golf">________</span>. There is something to be said about learning to control your body 
            to produce unique movements which directly affect the outcome of a shot. I may not be the best at it but the progression and grind to pursue a 
            better swing is something I enjoy. Frustrating at times, but certainly contains a lot of entertainment and satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would not say I am a huge movie buff, but I have recently started watching more movies. Due to my childhood circumstances, 
            I was not able to watch a wide variety of movies, even the classics were hard to come by! Since I have a lot of catching up to do, self-imposed surely, 
            I have set out to make some progress. The <span id="Alien">________</span> series was certainly a classic and stable series, now I feel as though I can understand the hype 
            surrounding it a bit more. On the flip side of that, watching all of the Austin Powers movies was also rewarding! I remembered clips here and there, 
            but actually watching them start to end put a lot of pieces together for me. All in all, I have a long ways to go and I plan to enjoy it every step of the way!
